            <h5>Background</h5>
            <p>Microstructural analysis was first described in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1554433/" target="_blank">Davis and Smith (1992)</a> and has since then been used understand diverse phenomena. In-depth reviews on many of these, and microstructural parameters used to study them, are available (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28684308/" target="_blank">Johnson, 2018</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31682949/" target="_blank">Naneix et al., 2020</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11161348/" target="_blank">Smith, 2001</a>). Briefly, although much of the foundational work on drinking microstruture was on licking for nutritive solutions (e.g., sucrose solutions), microstructural analysis can also be used to study intake of water (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23957745/" target="_blank">McKay & Daniels, 2013</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34020111/" target="_blank">Santollo et al., 2021</a>), ethanol (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648771/" target="_blank">Patwell et al., 2021</a>), and other tastants such as non-caloric artificial sweeteners, sodium, and quinine (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22484563/" target="_blank">Lin et al., 2012</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9608024/" target="_blank">Spector & St. John, 1998</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30705296/" target="_blank">Verharen et al., 2019</a>). Lick microstructure has been used to shed light on, for example, how licking is affected by neuropeptides (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23957745/" target="_blank">McKay & Daniels, 2013</a>), enzymes in the mouth (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35870707/" target="_blank">Chometton et al., 2022</a>), ovarian hormones (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34020111/" target="_blank">Santollo et al., 2021</a>), nutrient restriction (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31682949/" target="_blank">Naneix et al., 2020</a>), response to alcohol (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34648771/" target="_blank">Patwell et al., 2021</a>), and diet (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21983046/" target="_blank">Johnson, 2012</a>). The number of lick bouts over a session are thought to reflect postingestive feedback from the consumed fluid, wheras the number of licks in a bout are thought to reflect palatability of the solution.</p>

            <p>Lick microstructure can provide a great deal of interesting information about why an animal is drinking. Often, changes in microstructure are accompanied by changes in total intake, but this is not always the case: sometimes, equal intake will be achieved by quite different licking patterns that indicate changes in orosensory and postingestive feedback (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20006663/" target="_blank">Johnson et al., 2010</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32006660/" target="_blank">Volcko et al., 2020</a>). Analyzing lick microstructure is therefore highly valuable in understanding how a manipulation affects appetite; if <i>X</i> causes an animal to feel more satiated after drinking, that may lead to a different interpretation than if <i>X</i> were to reduce the palatability of the solution. Because of the value of microstrucural data, many labs habitually record and analyze it. There are many others, however, that have not yet begun collecting these data. Investing in lickometers can be costly, but there are an increasing number of alternatives to commercial products such as those produced by Med Associates. Several open-source lickometer designs are now available (e.g., <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s44277-024-00002-z" target="_blank">Frie & Khokhar, 2024</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39053773/" target="_blank">Monfared et al., 2024</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39317464/" target="_blank">Petersen et al., 2024</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30505996/" target="_blank">Raymond et al., 2018</a>; <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39025674/" target="_blank">Silva et al., 2024</a>). Recording individual licks with high temporal resolution is necessary for microstrucural analysis of drinking behavior, but another barrier to reporting microstructure is its analysis. This problem can now easily be solved by <code>lickcalc</code>. <code>lickcalc</code> does not require any special software or coding knowledge: all the user has to do is drag a file with timestamps of lick onset (and, ideally, offset) into the program and <code>lickcalc</code> will generate a detailed microstructural analysis, with a high degree of user control over key parameters.</p>
