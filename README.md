# lickcalc

A simple app for performing analysis of lick microstructure in experiments of rodent ingestive behaviour.

Earlier versions of this application can be found [here](https://github.com/jaimemcc/lickcalc_webapp) and [here](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/Lick-Calc-GUI).

## Installation

The application is hosted at [lickcalc.uit.no](https://lickcalc.uit.no)

To install locally, clone the repository and create an environment using the `environment.yml` file. You can use either `conda` or `mamba`:

```powershell
# Using conda
git clone https://github.com/uit-no/lickcalc.git
cd lickcalc
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate lickcalc
python app.py
```

```powershell
# Using mamba (recommended for speed)
git clone https://github.com/uit-no/lickcalc.git
cd lickcalc
mamba env create -f environment.yml
mamba activate lickcalc
python app.py
```

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- Windows, macOS, or Linux
- Conda or Mamba (recommended)



## Usage/Examples

Files can be opened by dragging into the interface. Various sliders allow parameters to be changed, calculations will update, and figures will be replotted. The GUI is designed to be easy-to-use and self-explanatory. For full documentation and citations to seminal experiments, see [lickcalc.uit.no/help](https://lickcalc.uit.no/help).




### Custom Configuration

You can customize the default parameter values by uploading a custom configuration file:

1. Copy the `custom_config_example.yaml` file
2. Modify the values to your preferred defaults
3. Click the "Load Config File" button at the top of the app
4. Upload your custom config file

The custom configuration will override the default values and remain active until you reload the app.



### Core Functions
Calculations are based on functions contained in the [trompy](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/trompy) package, particularly `lickcalc` and `medfilereader`. These packages can be installed separately with:

```powershell
pip install trompy
```

Core functions can also be extracted from this package and integrated with other code as required.
